## Separation Rules

Vision does not make decisions.

Poker engine does not know about AI.

AI does not depend on screenshots.

Every layer must be testable independently.

## AI Architecture

Recommended modular approach:

- State Encoder
- Hand Evaluation Module
- Opponent Model
- Strategy Network
- Decision Engine
- Memory System
